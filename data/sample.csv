Fair use rationale for Image:Wonju.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Wonju.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

Juelz Santanas Age

In 2002, Juelz Santana was 18 years old, then came February 18th, which makes Juelz turn 19 making songs with The Diplomats. The third neff to be signed to Cam's label under Roc A Fella. In 2003, he was 20 years old coming out with his own singles """"Santana's Town"""" and """"Down"""". So yes, he is born in 1983. He really is, how could he be older then Lloyd Banks?

As the author mentions, year-to-year changes can vary significantly due to factors like the weather, which is why they've provided averages. It's much more accurate to say that monarch populations have declined 43%.

If there is further habitat loss, it has to be due to some other factor.

It's also worth pointing out the opposite side of the issue. The adoption of herbicide-tolerant crops has reduced the use of tilling as a weed-control method. That, in turn, reduces erosion which can be extremely harmful to the environment.",0.0
